# 44608 - project 6 EDA

# Overview
Project 6 is an opportunity to create your own custom exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using GitHub, Git, Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and other popular data analytics tools.

# Objective
Perform and publish a custom EDA project to demnostrate skills with Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and popular tools for data analytics. The notebook should tell a data story and visually present findings in a clear and engaging manner.

# Dataset
I used the following
https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/flights.csv

It shows the number of passengers of flights by month from 1949 to 1960 from an undisclosed location/airport.

here's an example of the data set

| Year     | Month    | Passengers |
|----------|----------|------------|
| 1949     | January  | 112        |
| 1949     | February | 118        |
| 1949     | March    | 132        |
| 1949     | April    | 129        |
| 1949     | May      | 121        |
| 1949     | June     | 135        |
